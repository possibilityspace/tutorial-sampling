# Tutorial - Sampling Procedural Generators

![Sampling a Procedural Generator](http://www.possibilityspace.org/img/sampling.png)

This is an interactive tool that lets you edit a procedural level generator and then automatically sample it to understand what your changes did. Mike Cook made it as part of a series called Possibility Space.

You can find a full written tutorial with interactive Javascript examples here: http://www.possibilityspace.org/tutorial-sampling/

An initial version. I built the Processing version before doing extra work on the interactive p5.js versions, so there might be some differences. Spot anything - let me know!
